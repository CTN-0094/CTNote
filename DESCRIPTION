Title: CTN Outcomes, Treatments, and Endpoints
Description: CTNote is a coded collection of substance use disorder clinical
  trial outcomes. These coded outcome functions are used to compare and cluster
  different clinical outcome functions based on daily or weekly subject urine
  screenings. Note that we abbreviate urine drug screen as "UDS" and urine
  opioid screen as "UOS". For the example data sets (based on clinical trials
  data harmonized in CTN-0094), UDS and UOS are largely interchangable.
