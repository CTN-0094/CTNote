In spite of the immense amount of fruitful labour which has been expended in its practical applications, the basic principles of this organ of science are still in a state of obscurity, and it cannot be denied that, during the recent rapid development of practical methods, fundamental problems have been ignored and fundamental paradoxes left unresolved. This anomalous state of statistical science is strikingly exemplified by a recent paper entitled "The Fundamental Problem of Practical Statistics," in which one of the most eminent of modern statisticians presents what purports to be a general proof of BAYES' postulate, a proof which, in the opinion of a second statistician of equal eminence, "seems to rest upon a very peculiar -- not to say hardly supposable -- relation."},

All patients received drug counseling with parental or significant-other involvement to encourage adherence. Patients totaling 414 were approached, 343 gave informed consent, and 280 were randomized (mean age, 23.6 ± 0.4 years). At 6 months, two to three times as many naltrexone patients as naltrexone placebo patients remained in treatment and had not relapsed, odds ratio (OR) = 3.5 (1.96–6.12), p {\textless} .0001. Overall, adding fluoxetine did not improve outcomes, OR = 1.35 (0.68–2.66), p = .49; however, women receiving naltrexone and fluoxetine showed a trend toward a statistically significant advantage when compared to women receiving naltrexone and fluoxetine placebo, OR = 2.4 (0.88–6.59), p = .08. HIV risk, psychiatric symptoms, and overall adjustment were markedly improved among all patients who remained on treatment and did not relapse, regardless of group assignment. More widespread use of naltrexone could be an important addition to addiction treatment and HIV prevention in Russia.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), a program of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), has expanded from the initial six Nodes to 16 Nodes, as a nationwide consortium of research scientists and treatment providers working together to improve care for substance use in the nation’s communities. Encompassing both specialty care programs and general medical settings, the Network has become a unique resource for expertise on clinically focused research, bridging the gap between research and treatment delivery. Over 22 years, the CTN has completed 101 studies, resulting in 650 publications. In response to the opioid epidemic, a CTN task force generated a comprehensive list of research priorities in the areas of prevention, treatment, knowledge dissemination, and workforce training, to form the basis of the Network’s opioid portfolio. The Network’s opioid portfolio currently includes five main categories of studies: (1) large multi-site studies; (2) studies aimed at closing the treatment gap; (3) expansion of ongoing studies to improve service delivery and implementation; (4) studies to explore the use of substance use data in electronic health record systems; (5) training and dissemination projects to expand the research/health care provider workforce. With funding from the Helping to End Addiction Long-Term InitiativeSM (HEAL), the CTN established five new Nodes, which, along with the pre-existing Nodes, are distributed in every region of the nation and engage researchers and clinicians in areas that have been among the hardest hit by the opioid epidemic. Through this expanded network and its commitment to developing personalized, evidence-based treatments, the CTN is poised to address and provide solutions for the ongoing epidemic of opioid use and addiction.},
