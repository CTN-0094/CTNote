In spite of the immense amount of fruitful labour which has been expended in its practical applications, the basic principles of this organ of science are still in a state of obscurity, and it cannot be denied that, during the recent rapid development of practical methods, fundamental problems have been ignored and fundamental paradoxes left unresolved. This anomalous state of statistical science is strikingly exemplified by a recent paper entitled "The Fundamental Problem of Practical Statistics," in which one of the most eminent of modern statisticians presents what purports to be a general proof of BAYES' postulate, a proof which, in the opinion of a second statistician of equal eminence, "seems to rest upon a very peculiar -- not to say hardly supposable -- relation."},

All patients received drug counseling with parental or significant-other involvement to encourage adherence. Patients totaling 414 were approached, 343 gave informed consent, and 280 were randomized (mean age, 23.6 ± 0.4 years). At 6 months, two to three times as many naltrexone patients as naltrexone placebo patients remained in treatment and had not relapsed, odds ratio (OR) = 3.5 (1.96–6.12), p {\textless} .0001. Overall, adding fluoxetine did not improve outcomes, OR = 1.35 (0.68–2.66), p = .49; however, women receiving naltrexone and fluoxetine showed a trend toward a statistically significant advantage when compared to women receiving naltrexone and fluoxetine placebo, OR = 2.4 (0.88–6.59), p = .08. HIV risk, psychiatric symptoms, and overall adjustment were markedly improved among all patients who remained on treatment and did not relapse, regardless of group assignment. More widespread use of naltrexone could be an important addition to addiction treatment and HIV prevention in Russia.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), a program of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), has expanded from the initial six Nodes to 16 Nodes, as a nationwide consortium of research scientists and treatment providers working together to improve care for substance use in the nation’s communities. Encompassing both specialty care programs and general medical settings, the Network has become a unique resource for expertise on clinically focused research, bridging the gap between research and treatment delivery. Over 22 years, the CTN has completed 101 studies, resulting in 650 publications. In response to the opioid epidemic, a CTN task force generated a comprehensive list of research priorities in the areas of prevention, treatment, knowledge dissemination, and workforce training, to form the basis of the Network’s opioid portfolio. The Network’s opioid portfolio currently includes five main categories of studies: (1) large multi-site studies; (2) studies aimed at closing the treatment gap; (3) expansion of ongoing studies to improve service delivery and implementation; (4) studies to explore the use of substance use data in electronic health record systems; (5) training and dissemination projects to expand the research/health care provider workforce. With funding from the Helping to End Addiction Long-Term InitiativeSM (HEAL), the CTN established five new Nodes, which, along with the pre-existing Nodes, are distributed in every region of the nation and engage researchers and clinicians in areas that have been among the hardest hit by the opioid epidemic. Through this expanded network and its commitment to developing personalized, evidence-based treatments, the CTN is poised to address and provide solutions for the ongoing epidemic of opioid use and addiction.},

In this paper, we contrast media coverage of white non-medical opioid users with that of black and brown heroin users to show how divergent representations lead to different public and policy responses. A content analysis of 100 popular press articles from 2001 and 2011 in which half describe heroin users and half describe prescription opioid users revealed a consistent contrast between criminalized urban black and Latino heroin injectors with sympathetic portrayals of suburban white prescription opioid users. Media coverage of the suburban and rural opioid “epidemic” of the 2000s helped draw a symbolic, and then legal, distinction between (urban) heroin addiction and (suburban and rural) prescription opioid addiction that is reminiscent of the legal distinction between crack cocaine and powder cocaine of the 1980s and 1990s. This distinction reinforces the racialized deployment of the War on Drugs and is sustained by the lack of explicit discussion of race in the service of “color blind ideology.” We suggest potential correctives to these racially divergent patterns, in the form of socially responsible media practices and of clinical engagement with public policy.},

Brief treatment (phase 1) included 2-week buprenorphine-naloxone stabilization, 2-week taper, and 8-week postmedication follow-up. Patients with successful opioid use outcomes exited the study; unsuccessful patients entered phase 2: extended (12-week) buprenorphine-naloxone treatment, 4-week taper, and 8-week postmedication follow-up.Ten US sites.A total of 653 treatment-seeking outpatients dependent on prescription opioids.In both phases, patients were randomized to standard medical management (SMM) or SMM plus opioid dependence counseling; all received buprenorphine-naloxone.Predefined“successful outcome” in each phase: composite measures indicating minimal or no opioid use based on urine test–confirmed self-reports.During phase 1, only 6.6\% (43 of 653) of patients had successful outcomes, with no difference between SMM and SMM plus opioid dependence counseling. In contrast, 49.2\% (177 of 360) attained successful outcomes in phase 2 during extended buprenorphine-naloxone treatment (week 12), with no difference between counseling conditions. Success rates 8 weeks after completing the buprenorphine-naloxone taper (phase 2, week 24) dropped to 8.6\% (31 of 360), again with no counseling difference. In secondary analyses, successful phase 2 outcomes were more common while taking buprenorphine-naloxone than 8 weeks after taper (49.2\% [177 of 360] vs 8.6\% [31 of 360], P \&lt; .001). Chronic pain did not affect opioid use outcomes; a history of ever using heroin was associated with lower phase 2 success rates while taking buprenorphine-naloxone.Prescription opioid–dependent patients are most likely to reduce opioid use during buprenorphine-naloxone treatment; if tapered off buprenorphine-naloxone, even after 12 weeks of treatment, the likelihood of an unsuccessful outcome is high, even in patients receiving counseling in addition to SMM.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00316277},

	doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32812-X},
	abstract = {Background
Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), an opioid antagonist, and sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX), a partial opioid agonist, are pharmacologically and conceptually distinct interventions to prevent opioid relapse. We aimed to estimate the difference in opioid relapse-free survival between XR-NTX and BUP-NX.
Methods
We initiated this 24 week, open-label, randomised controlled, comparative effectiveness trial at eight US community-based inpatient services and followed up participants as outpatients. Participants were 18 years or older, had Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 opioid use disorder, and had used non-prescribed opioids in the past 30 days. We stratified participants by treatment site and opioid use severity and used a web-based permuted block design with random equally weighted block sizes of four and six for randomisation (1:1) to receive XR-NTX or BUP-NX. XR-NTX was monthly intramuscular injections (Vivitrol; Alkermes) and BUP-NX was daily self-administered buprenorphine-naloxone sublingual film (Suboxone; Indivior). The primary outcome was opioid relapse-free survival during 24 weeks of outpatient treatment. Relapse was 4 consecutive weeks of any non-study opioid use by urine toxicology or self-report, or 7 consecutive days of self-reported use. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02032433.
Findings
Between Jan 30, 2014, and May 25, 2016, we randomly assigned 570 participants to receive XR-NTX (n=283) or BUP-NX (n=287). The last follow-up visit was Jan 31, 2017. As expected, XR-NTX had a substantial induction hurdle: fewer participants successfully initiated XR-NTX (204 [72\%] of 283) than BUP-NX (270 [94\%] of 287; p{\textless}0·0001). Among all participants who were randomly assigned (intention-to-treat population, n=570) 24 week relapse events were greater for XR-NTX (185 [65\%] of 283) than for BUP-NX (163 [57\%] of 287; hazard ratio [HR] 1·36, 95\% CI 1·10–1·68), most or all of this difference accounted for by early relapse in nearly all (70 [89\%] of 79) XR-NTX induction failures. Among participants successfully inducted (per-protocol population, n=474), 24 week relapse events were similar across study groups (p=0·44). Opioid-negative urine samples (p{\textless}0·0001) and opioid-abstinent days (p{\textless}0·0001) favoured BUP-NX compared with XR-NTX among the intention-to-treat population, but were similar across study groups among the per-protocol population. Self-reported opioid craving was initially less with XR-NTX than with BUP-NX (p=0·0012), then converged by week 24 (p=0·20). With the exception of mild-to-moderate XR-NTX injection site reactions, treatment-emergent adverse events including overdose did not differ between treatment groups. Five fatal overdoses occurred (two in the XR-NTX group and three in the BUP-NX group).
Interpretation
In this population it is more difficult to initiate patients to XR-NTX than BUP-NX, and this negatively affected overall relapse. However, once initiated, both medications were equally safe and effective. Future work should focus on facilitating induction to XR-NTX and on improving treatment retention for both medications.

At each step, beginning with the correlation matrix, all clusters and unclustered variables are tried in all possible pairs, and that pair producing the highest average intercorrelation within the trial cluster is chosen as the new cluster. In contrast to other types of cluster analysis in which a single set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive clusters is formed, this technique proceeds sequentially from tighter, less inclusive clusters through larger more inclusive clusters and is continued until all variables are clustered in a single group. A graph, constructed like the taxonomic dendrogram of the biological systematist, shows the class-inclusive relations between clusters and the value of the clustering criterion associated with each.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a number of applications of the k-means, a procedure for classifying a random sample of points in E sub N.  The procedure consists of starting with k groups which each consist of a single random point, and thereafter adding the points one after another to the group whose mean each point is nearest.  After a point is added to a group, the mean of that group is adjusted so as to take account of the new point.  Thus at each stage there are in fact k means, one for each group.  After the sample is processed in this way, the points are classified on the basis of nearness to the final means.  The portions which result tend to be fficient in the sense of having low within class variance.  Applications are suggested for the problems of non-linear prediction, efficient communication, non-parametric tests of independence, similarity grouping, and automatic file construction.  The extension of the methods to general metric spaces is indicated. Author},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) reduce opioid use and overdose; however, MOUD clinical trials have used varying primary outcomes to document treatment success. We conducted a literature review to assess and critically examine the methodologies used in MOUD treatment studies. Methods Published studies in English that examined MOUD (buprenorphine, methadone, or extended-release naltrexone) were included (N = 20). The methods and frequencies of measuring primary opioid outcomes, including urine drug tests (UDTs) and self-report of opioid use were compared among studies. Results A total of 20 studies fit the inclusion criteria. Each study assessed opioid use; only 12 had opioid use as a primary outcome. Other primary outcomes included retention in treatment (N = 6), and two had other primary outcomes (death and opioid withdrawal symptoms). Opioid use was assessed through both self-report and UDTs in 15 studies. Two studies did not use UDTs. Differences were found in the methods used for how opioid use, retention in treatment, self-report of opioid use, and UDTs were measured. Discussion and Conclusions The different primary outcomes used and operational definitions in each study make comparisons between studies difficult. The use of both self-report and UDTs for opioid use has several advantages, and if possible, researchers should use both measures. Scientific Significance This is the first review critically examining outcome measures from MOUD treatment studies. Creating a standard for opioid treatment outcomes in MOUD studies will allow for generalizable results that can inform both researchers and clinicians to better care for those with OUD.
