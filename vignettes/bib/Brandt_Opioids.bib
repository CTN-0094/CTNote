	abstract = {No randomized trials have examined treatments for prescription opioid dependence, despite its increasing prevalence.To evaluate the efficacy of brief and extended buprenorphine hydrochloride–naloxone hydrochloride treatment, with different counseling intensities, for patients dependent on prescription opioids.Multisite, randomized clinical trial using a 2-phase adaptive treatment research design. Brief treatment (phase 1) included 2-week buprenorphine-naloxone stabilization, 2-week taper, and 8-week postmedication follow-up. Patients with successful opioid use outcomes exited the study; unsuccessful patients entered phase 2: extended (12-week) buprenorphine-naloxone treatment, 4-week taper, and 8-week postmedication follow-up.Ten US sites.A total of 653 treatment-seeking outpatients dependent on prescription opioids.In both phases, patients were randomized to standard medical management (SMM) or SMM plus opioid dependence counseling; all received buprenorphine-naloxone.Predefined“successful outcome” in each phase: composite measures indicating minimal or no opioid use based on urine test–confirmed self-reports.During phase 1, only 6.6\% (43 of 653) of patients had successful outcomes, with no difference between SMM and SMM plus opioid dependence counseling. In contrast, 49.2\% (177 of 360) attained successful outcomes in phase 2 during extended buprenorphine-naloxone treatment (week 12), with no difference between counseling conditions. Success rates 8 weeks after completing the buprenorphine-naloxone taper (phase 2, week 24) dropped to 8.6\% (31 of 360), again with no counseling difference. In secondary analyses, successful phase 2 outcomes were more common while taking buprenorphine-naloxone than 8 weeks after taper (49.2\% [177 of 360] vs 8.6\% [31 of 360], P \&lt; .001). Chronic pain did not affect opioid use outcomes; a history of ever using heroin was associated with lower phase 2 success rates while taking buprenorphine-naloxone.Prescription opioid–dependent patients are most likely to reduce opioid use during buprenorphine-naloxone treatment; if tapered off buprenorphine-naloxone, even after 12 weeks of treatment, the likelihood of an unsuccessful outcome is high, even in patients receiving counseling in addition to SMM.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00316277},

	abstract = {Oral naltrexone can completely antagonize the effects produced by opioid agonists. However, poor compliance with naltrexone has been a major obstacle to the effective treatment of opioid dependence.To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a sustained-release depot formulation of naltrexone in treating opioid dependence.Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week trial conducted at 2 medical centers.Sixty heroin-dependent adults.Participants were stratified by sex and years of heroin use (≥5 vs \&lt;5) and then were randomized to receive placebo or 192 or 384 mg of depot naltrexone. Doses were administered at the beginning of weeks 1 and 5. All participants received twice-weekly relapse prevention therapy, provided observed urine samples, and completed other assessments at each visit.Retention in treatment and percentage of opioid-negative urine samples.Retention in treatment was dose related, with 39\%, 60\%, and 68\% of patients in the placebo, 192 mg of naltrexone, and 384 mg of naltrexone groups, respectively, remaining in treatment at the end of 2 months. Time to dropout had a significant main effect of dose, with mean time to dropout of 27, 36, and 48 days for the placebo, 192 mg of naltrexone, and 384 mg of naltrexone groups, respectively. The percentage of urine samples negative for opioids, methadone, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and amphetamine varied significantly as a function of dose. When the data were recalculated without the assumption that missing urine samples were positive, a main effect of group was not found for any drugs tested except cocaine, where the percentage of cocaine-negative urine samples was lower in the placebo group. Adverse events were minimal and generally mild. This formulation of naltrexone was well tolerated and produced a robust, dose-related increase in treatment retention.These data provide new evidence of the feasibility, efficacy, and tolerability of long-lasting antagonist treatments for opioid dependence.{\textless}!--

	abstract = {Background and Objectives Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) reduce opioid use and overdose; however, MOUD clinical trials have used varying primary outcomes to document treatment success. We conducted a literature review to assess and critically examine the methodologies used in MOUD treatment studies. Methods Published studies in English that examined MOUD (buprenorphine, methadone, or extended-release naltrexone) were included (N = 20). The methods and frequencies of measuring primary opioid outcomes, including urine drug tests (UDTs) and self-report of opioid use were compared among studies. Results A total of 20 studies fit the inclusion criteria. Each study assessed opioid use; only 12 had opioid use as a primary outcome. Other primary outcomes included retention in treatment (N = 6), and two had other primary outcomes (death and opioid withdrawal symptoms). Opioid use was assessed through both self-report and UDTs in 15 studies. Two studies did not use UDTs. Differences were found in the methods used for how opioid use, retention in treatment, self-report of opioid use, and UDTs were measured. Discussion and Conclusions The different primary outcomes used and operational definitions in each study make comparisons between studies difficult. The use of both self-report and UDTs for opioid use has several advantages, and if possible, researchers should use both measures. Scientific Significance This is the first review critically examining outcome measures from MOUD treatment studies. Creating a standard for opioid treatment outcomes in MOUD studies will allow for generalizable results that can inform both researchers and clinicians to better care for those with OUD.

Self-reported heroin use decreased in a dose-related manner. At final assessment, patients in the high-dose condition reported using heroin 2.5 of 30 days as compared with 4.1 or 6.3 days for patients in the medium-dose and low-dose conditions, respectively (high dose vs low dose, P\&lt;.05); urinalysis results were similarly dose related. Overall, 20 (34\%) of 59 patients in the high-dose condition remained opioidabstinent for 4 consecutive weeks, as compared with 8 (14\%) of 59 in the medium-dose and 7 (11\%) of 62 in the low-dose conditions (P\&lt;.01). Self-report and urinalysis data are consistent with a greater than 90\% reduction in illicit opioid use by the high-dose group relative to pretreatment levels.Conclusion.—Opioid substitution treatment with LAAM substantially reduces illicit opioid use. The clinical efficacy of LAAM is positively related to dose.},

Subjects were randomized to receive either buprenorphine or methadone in an open, comparative study. Setting. Subjects were recruited and treated at the drug addiction outpatient clinic at the University of Vienna. Participants. Sixty subjects (19 females and 41 males) who met DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence and were seeking treatment. Intervention. Subjects received either sublingual buprenorphine (2-mg or 8-mg tablets; maximum daily dose 8 mg) or oral methadone (racemic D -/+ L-methadone; maximum daily dose 80 mg). A stable dose was maintained following the 6-day induction phase. Measurement. Assessment of treatment retention and illicit substance use (opiates, cocaine and benzodiazepines) was made by urinalysis. Findings. The retention rate was significantly better in the methadone maintained group (p{\textless} 0.05) but subjects completing the study in the buprenorphine group had significantly lower rates of illicit opiate consumption (p = 0.04). Conclusion. The results support the superiority of methadone with respect to retention rate. However, they also confirm previous reports of buprenorphine use as an alternative in maintenance therapy for opiate addiction, suggesting that a specific subgroup may be benefiting from buprenorphine. This is the first comparative trial to use sublingual buprenorphine tablets: previously published comparison studies refer to 30\% solutions of buprenorphine in alcohol.},

	abstract = {Background
RBP-6000, referred to as BUP-XR (extended-release buprenorphine), is a subcutaneously injected, monthly buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder. BUP-XR provides sustained buprenorphine plasma concentrations to block drug-liking of abused opioids over the entire monthly dosing period, while controlling withdrawal and craving symptoms. Administration of BUP-XR in a health-care setting also mitigates abuse, misuse, diversion, and unintentional exposure. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of different BUP-XR dosing regimens in participants with opioid use disorder.
Methods
This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 36 treatment centres in the USA. Treatment-seeking adults aged 18–65 years who had moderate or severe opioid use disorder (as defined by the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) entered an open-label run-in phase of up to 2 weeks' treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone sublingual film. Eligible participants were then randomly assigned (4:4:1:1) with an interactive voice/web-response system to receive BUP-XR 300 mg/300 mg (six injections of 300 mg), BUP-XR 300 mg/100 mg (two injections of 300 mg plus four injections of 100 mg), or volume-matched placebo every 28 days, and received weekly individual drug counselling. No supplemental buprenorphine was allowed. The primary efficacy endpoint was participants' percentage abstinence from opioid use, defined as the percentage of each participant's negative urine samples and self-reports of illicit opioid use from week 5 to week 24, analysed in the full analysis set. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of BUP-XR or placebo. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02357901.
Findings
From Jan 28, 2015, to Nov 12, 2015, 1187 potential participants were screened, 665 entered run-in, and 504 received BUP-XR 300 mg/300 mg (n=201), BUP-XR 300 mg/100 mg (n=203), or placebo (n=100). Mean participants' percentage abstinence was 41·3\% (SD 39·7) for BUP-XR 300 mg/300 mg and 42·7\% (38·5) for 300 mg/100 mg, compared with 5·0\% (17·0) for placebo (p{\textless}0·0001 for both BUP-XR regimens). No compensatory non-opioid drug use was observed during BUP-XR treatment. The most common adverse events were headache (17 [8\%] participants in the BUP-XR 300 mg/300 mg group vs 19 [9\%] participants in the BUP-XR 300 mg/100 mg group vs six [6\%] participants in the placebo group), constipation (16 [8\%] vs 19 [9\%] vs 0), nausea (16 [8\%] vs 18 [9\%] vs five [5\%]), and injection-site pruritis (19 [9\%] vs 13 [6\%] vs four [4\%]). The BUP-XR safety profile was consistent with other buprenorphine products for treatment of opioid use disorder, except for injection-site reactions, which were reported in more than 5\% of all participants who received BUP-XR, but were mostly mild and not treatment-limiting.
Interpretation
Participants' percentage abstinence was significantly higher in both BUP-XR groups than in the placebo group. Treatment with BUP-XR was also well tolerated. The availability of this monthly formulation, delivered by health-care providers, represents an advance in treatment for opioid use disorder that enhances the benefits of buprenorphine by delivering sustained, optimal exposure, while reducing risks of current buprenorphine products.

	abstract = {Buprenorphine at 2 mg and 6 mg daily was compared with methadone at 35 mg and 65 mg during 24 weeks of maintenance among 125 opioid-dependent patients. As hypothesized, 6 mg of buprenorphine were superior to 2 mg of buprenorphine in reducing illicit opioid use, but higher dosage did not improve treatment retention. Self-reported illicit opioid use declined substantially in all groups, but by the third month, significantly more heroin abuse was reported at 2 mg than at 6 mg of buprenorphine or of methadone. From an initial average of \$1860/month, month 3 usage dropped to \$41 (methadone 65 mg), \$73 (methadone 35 mg), \$118 (buprenorphine 6 mg), and \$35I/month (buprenorphine 2 mg). Days of use also dropped from 29 days to 1.7 (methadone 65 mg), 2.8 (methadone 35 mg), 4.0 (buprenorphine 6 mg), and 6.6 days/month (buprenorphine 2 mg). This relatively low efficacy for 2 mg of buprenorphine persisted through month 6 of the trial, with 7.2 days/month and \$235/month of use for buprenorphine at 2 mg versus 1.9 days/month and \$65/month for the other three groups. Increased opioid abuse also was associated with significantly greater and persistent opioid withdrawal symptoms. Our secondary hypothesis, that buprenorphine would be equivalent to methadone in efficacy, was not supported. Treatment retention was significantly better on methadone (20 us. 16 weeks), and methadone patients had significantly more opioid-free urines (51\% vs. 26\%). Abstinence for at least 3 weeks was also more common on methadone than buprenorphine (65\% vs. 27\%). Thus, methadone was clearly superior to these two buprenorphine doses, but illicit opioid use was reduced more by higher than lower buprenorphine dosage. Future studies need to examine higher sublingual buprenorphine doses of 12 mg to 20 mg daily for potential efficacy.},

	abstract = {Background
Opioid dependence is associated with low rates of treatment-seeking, poor adherence to treatment, frequent relapse, and major societal consequences. We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and patient-reported outcomes of an injectable, once monthly extended-release formulation of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) for treatment of patients with opioid dependence after detoxification.
Methods
We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week trial of patients with opioid dependence disorder. Patients aged 18 years or over who had 30 days or less of inpatient detoxification and 7 days or more off all opioids were enrolled at 13 clinical sites in Russia. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either 380 mg XR-NTX or placebo by an interactive voice response system, stratified by site and gender in a centralised, permuted-block method. Participants also received 12 biweekly counselling sessions. Participants, investigators, staff, and the sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the response profile for confirmed abstinence during weeks 5–24, assessed by urine drug tests and self report of non-use. Secondary endpoints were self-reported opioid-free days, opioid craving scores, number of days of retention, and relapse to physiological opioid dependence. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00678418.
Findings
Between July 3, 2008, and Oct 5, 2009, 250 patients were randomly assigned to XR-NTX (n=126) or placebo (n=124). The median proportion of weeks of confirmed abstinence was 90·0\% (95\% CI 69·9–92·4) in the XR-NTX group compared with 35·0\% (11·4–63·8) in the placebo group (p=0·0002). Patients in the XR-NTX group self-reported a median of 99·2\% (range 89·1–99·4) opioid-free days compared with 60·4\% (46·2–94·0) for the placebo group (p=0·0004). The mean change in craving was −10·1 (95\% CI −12·3 to −7·8) in the XR-NTX group compared with 0·7 (−3·1 to 4·4) in the placebo group (p{\textless}0·0001). Median retention was over 168 days in the XR-NTX group compared with 96 days (95\% CI 63–165) in the placebo group (p=0·0042). Naloxone challenge confirmed relapse to physiological opioid dependence in 17 patients in the placebo group compared with one in the XR-NTX group (p{\textless}0·0001). XR-NTX was well tolerated. Two patients in each group discontinued owing to adverse events. No XR-NTX-treated patients died, overdosed, or discontinued owing to severe adverse events.
Interpretation
XR-NTX represents a new treatment option that is distinct from opioid agonist maintenance treatment. XR-NTX in conjunction with psychosocial treatment might improve acceptance of opioid dependence pharmacotherapy and provide a useful treatment option for many patients.

	abstract = {Background
Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), an opioid antagonist, and sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX), a partial opioid agonist, are pharmacologically and conceptually distinct interventions to prevent opioid relapse. We aimed to estimate the difference in opioid relapse-free survival between XR-NTX and BUP-NX.
Methods
We initiated this 24 week, open-label, randomised controlled, comparative effectiveness trial at eight US community-based inpatient services and followed up participants as outpatients. Participants were 18 years or older, had Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 opioid use disorder, and had used non-prescribed opioids in the past 30 days. We stratified participants by treatment site and opioid use severity and used a web-based permuted block design with random equally weighted block sizes of four and six for randomisation (1:1) to receive XR-NTX or BUP-NX. XR-NTX was monthly intramuscular injections (Vivitrol; Alkermes) and BUP-NX was daily self-administered buprenorphine-naloxone sublingual film (Suboxone; Indivior). The primary outcome was opioid relapse-free survival during 24 weeks of outpatient treatment. Relapse was 4 consecutive weeks of any non-study opioid use by urine toxicology or self-report, or 7 consecutive days of self-reported use. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02032433.
Findings
Between Jan 30, 2014, and May 25, 2016, we randomly assigned 570 participants to receive XR-NTX (n=283) or BUP-NX (n=287). The last follow-up visit was Jan 31, 2017. As expected, XR-NTX had a substantial induction hurdle: fewer participants successfully initiated XR-NTX (204 [72\%] of 283) than BUP-NX (270 [94\%] of 287; p{\textless}0·0001). Among all participants who were randomly assigned (intention-to-treat population, n=570) 24 week relapse events were greater for XR-NTX (185 [65\%] of 283) than for BUP-NX (163 [57\%] of 287; hazard ratio [HR] 1·36, 95\% CI 1·10–1·68), most or all of this difference accounted for by early relapse in nearly all (70 [89\%] of 79) XR-NTX induction failures. Among participants successfully inducted (per-protocol population, n=474), 24 week relapse events were similar across study groups (p=0·44). Opioid-negative urine samples (p{\textless}0·0001) and opioid-abstinent days (p{\textless}0·0001) favoured BUP-NX compared with XR-NTX among the intention-to-treat population, but were similar across study groups among the per-protocol population. Self-reported opioid craving was initially less with XR-NTX than with BUP-NX (p=0·0012), then converged by week 24 (p=0·20). With the exception of mild-to-moderate XR-NTX injection site reactions, treatment-emergent adverse events including overdose did not differ between treatment groups. Five fatal overdoses occurred (two in the XR-NTX group and three in the BUP-NX group).
Interpretation
In this population it is more difficult to initiate patients to XR-NTX than BUP-NX, and this negatively affected overall relapse. However, once initiated, both medications were equally safe and effective. Future work should focus on facilitating induction to XR-NTX and on improving treatment retention for both medications.

Patients with buprenorphine implants had a mean percentage of urine samples that tested negative for illicit opioids across weeks 1 through 16 of 40.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 34.2\%-46.7\%) and a median of 40.7\%; whereas those in the placebo group had a mean of 28.3\% (95\% CI, 20.3\%-36.3\%) and a median of 20.8\%. A total of 71 of 108 patients (65.7\%) who received buprenorphine implants completed the study vs 17 of 55 (30.9\%) who received placebo implants (P \&lt; .001). Those who received buprenorphine implants also had fewer clinician-rated (P \&lt;.001) and patient-rated (P = .004) withdrawal symptoms, had lower patient ratings of craving (P \&lt;.001), and experienced a greater change on clinician global ratings of severity of opioid dependence (P\&lt;.001) and on the clinician global ratings of improvement (P \&lt; .001) than those who received placebo implants. Minor implant site reactions were the most common adverse events: 61 patients (56.5\%) in the buprenorphine group and 29 (52.7\%) in the placebo group.Among persons with opioid dependence, the use of buprenorphine implants compared with placebo resulted in less opioid use over 16 weeks as assessed by urine samples.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00447564},

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of an 8 mg/day sublingual dose of buprenorphine in the maintenance treatment of heroin addicts by comparison with a 1 mg/day dose over a 16-week treatment period. As a secondary objective, outcomes were determined concurrently for patients treated with two other dose levels . Design. Patients were randomized to four dosage groups and treated double-blind . Setting. Twelve outpatient opiate maintenance treatment centers throughout the United States . Participants. Two hundred and thirty-nine women and 497 men who met the DSM-III-R criteria for opioid dependence and were seeking treatment . Intervention. Patients received either 1, 4, 8 or 16 mg/day of buprenorphine and were treated in the usual clinical context, including a 1-hour weekly clinical counseling session . Measurement. Retention in treatment, illicit opioid use as determined by urine toxicology, opioid craving and global ratings by patient and staff. Safety outcome measures were provided by clinical monitoring and by analysis of the reported adverse events . Findings. Outcomes in the 8 mg group were significantly better than in the 1 mg group in all four efficacy domains. No deaths occurred in either group. The 8 mg group did not show an increase in the frequency of adverse events. Most reported adverse effects were those commonly seen in patients treated with opioids . Conclusions. The findings support the safety and efficacy of buprenorphine and suggest that an adequate dose of buprenorphine will be a useful addition to pharmacotherapy.},

	abstract = {• This was a double-blind comparison of methadyl acetate and two dose levels of methadone hydrochloride in the maintenance of 430 street heroin addicts from 12 Veterans Administration hospitals. The starting sample consisted of 146 patients receiving low-dose methadone, 142 patients receiving high-dose methadone, and 142 patients receiving methadyl acetate. Patients were first given 30 mg of both drugs, and doses were incremented by 10 mg/week until they stabilized at methadyl acetate, 80 mg three times a week, and methadone hydrochloride, 50 mg daily or 100 mg daily. Dosage was fixed for the balance of the 40-week treatment period. Safety was evaluated by clinical and laboratory observations conducted at frequent intervals throughout the study. Relative efficacy was evaluated by illicit drug use, program retention and attendance, and global staff judgments. It is concluded that methadyl acetate is as safe a drug as methadone and that it compares favorably with highdose methadone in terms of efficacy. Both methadyl acetate and high-dose methadone appear to be better maintenance regimens than low-dose methadone under the conditions of this study.},

Participants were treatment-seeking adults with moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder.Randomization to daily SL placebo and weekly (first 12 weeks; phase 1) and monthly (last 12 weeks; phase 2) SC buprenorphine (SC-BPN group) or to daily SL buprenorphine with naloxone (24 weeks) with matched weekly and monthly SC placebo injections (SL-BPN/NX group).Primary end points tested for noninferiority were response rate (10\% margin) and the mean proportion of opioid-negative urine samples for 24 weeks (11\% margin). Responder status was defined as having no evidence of illicit opioid use for at least 8 of 10 prespecified points during weeks 9 to 24, with 2 of these at week 12 and during month 6 (weeks 21-24). The mean proportion of samples with no evidence of illicit opioid use (weeks 4-24) evaluated by a cumulative distribution function (CDF) was an a priori secondary outcome with planned superiority testing if the response rate demonstrated noninferiority.A total of 428 participants (263 men [61.4\%] and 165 women [38.6\%]; mean [SD] age, 38.4 [11.0] years) were randomized to the SL-BPN/NX group (n = 215) or the SC-BPN group (n = 213). The response rates were 31 of 215 (14.4\%) for the SL-BPN/NX group and 37 of 213 (17.4\%) for the SC-BPN group, a 3.0\% difference (95\% CI, −4.0\% to 9.9\%; P \&lt; .001). The proportion of opioid-negative urine samples was 1099 of 3870 (28.4\%) for the SL-BPN/NX group and 1347 of 3834 (35.1\%) for the SC-BPN group, a 6.7\% difference (95\% CI, −0.1\% to 13.6\%; P \&lt; .001). The CDF for the SC-BPN group (26.7\%) was statistically superior to the CDF for the SL-BPN/NX group (0; P = .004). Injection site adverse events (none severe) occurred in 48 participants (22.3\%) in the SL-BPN/NX group and 40 (18.8\%) in the SC-BPN group.Compared with SL buprenorphine, depot buprenorphine did not result in an inferior likelihood of being a responder or having urine test results negative for opioids and produced superior results on the CDF of no illicit opioid use. These data suggest that depot buprenorphine is efficacious and may have advantages.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02651584},

Design Patients were randomized to receive buprenorphine or methadone over a 13-week treatment period in a double-blind, double-dummy trial. Setting Three methadone clinics in Australia. Participants Four hundred and five opioid-dependent patients seeking treatment. Intervention Patients received buprenorphine or methadone as indicated clinically using a flexible dosage regime. During weeks 1–6, patients were dosed daily. From weeks 7–13, buprenorphine patients received double their week 6 dose on alternate days. Measurements Retention in treatment, and illicit opioid use as determined by urinalysis. Self-reported drug use, psychological functioning, HIV-risk behaviour, general health and subjective ratings were secondary outcomes. Findings Intention-to-treat analyses revealed no significant difference in completion rates at 13 weeks. Methadone was superior to buprenorphine in time to termination over the 13-week period (Wald χ2 = 4.371, df = 1, P = 0.037), but not separately for the single-day or alternate-day dosing phases. There were no significant between-group differences in morphine-positive urines, or in self-reported heroin or other illicit drug use. The majority (85\%) of the buprenorphine patients transferred to alternate-day dosing were maintained in alternate-day dosing. Conclusions Buprenorphine did not differ from methadone in its ability to suppress heroin use, but retained approximately 10\% fewer patients. This poorer retention was due possibly to too-slow induction onto buprenorphine. For the majority of patients, buprenorphine can be administered on alternate days.},

Design Twelve-week single-site, two-group parallel randomized double-blind clinical trial. Setting An out-patient clinical research program in Tehran, Iran. Participants Following medically assisted withdrawal, participants with opioid use disorder were assigned randomly to NTX (n = 51) or BNX (n = 51). Intervention Medications were administered three times per week, double-blind, double-dummy for 12 weeks. All participants received weekly group drug counseling. Measurements The primary outcome was initial duration of opioid abstinence verified by urine toxicology tests. Secondary outcomes included the number of opioid-negative urine tests, treatment retention and proportions with sustained, verified opioid-abstinence for 12 weeks. Findings Mean [95\% confidence interval (CI)] number of days of initial duration of verified abstinence was 28.8 (20.0–37.5) with BNX and 21.6 (14.4–28.7) with NTX (P = 0.205). The mean (95\% CI) number of opioid-negative urine tests was 19.7 (17.7–21.6) with BNX and 15.4 (13.1–17.8) with NTX (P = 0.049).

Since the product available for large scale use is in tablet form, one intended to verify the efficacy of this formulation. In a multicentre randomised controlled double blind study, 72 opioid dependent patients were assigned to treatment with buprenorphine (8 mg/day) or methadone (60 mg/day) for a period of 6 months. The two compounds did not show any significant difference with regard to urinalyses: the average percentage of analyses proving negative was 60.4\% for patients assigned to buprenorphine, and 65.5\% for those assigned to methadone. With regard to retention, a non-significant trend in favour of methadone was observed. Patients completing the trial improved significantly in terms of psychosocial adjustment and global functioning, as ascertained by the DSM-IV-GAF and symptom checklist-90 (SCL-90) scales, and this was independent of the treatment group. Finally, in the case of buprenorphine, patients who dropped out differed significantly from those who stayed, in terms of a higher level of psychopathological symptoms, and a lower level of psychosocial functioning. The results of the study further support the utility of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence.},

Fifty-eight patients seeking treatment for opioid dependence were recruited in three outpatient facilities and randomly assigned to substitution with buprenorphine or methadone. The retention rate was significantly better in the methadone maintained group (90 vs. 56\%; P{\textless}0.001). Subjects completing the study in both the treatment groups had similar proportions of opioid positive urine samples (buprenorphine 62\%; methadone 59\%) and positive urine specimens, as well as mean heroin craving scores decreased significantly over time (P=0.035 and P{\textless}0.001). The proportion of cocaine-positive toxicology results did not differ between groups. At week six mean stabilization doses were 10.5 mg per day for the sublingual buprenorphine tablet, and 69.8 mg per day for methadone, respectively. Patient performance during maintenance was similar in both the groups. The high attrition rate in the buprenorphine group during the induction phase might reflect inadequate induction doses. Thus, buprenorphine is a viable alternative for methadone in short-term maintenance treatment for heroin dependence if treatment induction is done with adequate dosages.},

This study evaluated a behavioral intervention, a pharmacological intervention, and a combination of both interventions.Throughout the study all patients received daily methadone hydrochloride maintenance (initially 50 mg/d orally) and weekly counseling. Following baseline treatment patients who continued to use heroin were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 interventions: (1) contingent vouchers for opiate-negative urine specimens (n=29 patients); (2) methadone hydrochloride dose increase to 70 mg/d (n=31 patients); (3) combined contingent vouchers and methadone dose increase (n=32 patients); and (4) neither intervention (comparison standard; n=28 patients). Methadone dose increases were double blind. Vouchers had monetary value and were exchangeable for goods and services. Groups not receiving contingent vouchers received matching vouchers independent of urine test results. Primary outcome measure was opiate-negative urine specimens (thrice weekly urinalysis).Contingent vouchers and a methadone dose increase each significantly increased the percentage of opiate-negative urine specimens during intervention. Contingent vouchers, with or without a methadone dose increase, increased the duration of sustained abstinence as assessed by urine screenings. Methadone dose increase, with or without contingent vouchers, reduced self-reported frequency of use and self-reported craving.In patients enrolled in a methadone-maintainence program who continued to use heroin, abstinence reinforcement and a methadone dose increase were each effective in reducing use. When combined, they did not dramatically enhance each other's effects on any 1 outcome measure, but they did seem to have complementary benefits.Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2000;57:395-404--{\textgreater}},

The noninferiority established for the lower bound of the 95\% confidence interval  was greater than −0.20 (P \&lt; .025). Secondary end points included cumulative percentage of negative opioid urine results, abstinence, and time to first illicit opioid use. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting.Of 177 participants (mean age, 39 years; 40.9\% female), 90 were randomized to sublingual buprenorphine with placebo implants and 87 to buprenorphine implants with sublingual placebo; 165 of 177 (93.2\%) completed the trial. Eighty-one of 84 (96.4\%) receiving buprenorphine implants and 78 of 89 (87.6\%) receiving sublingual buprenorphine were responders, an 8.8\% difference (1-sided 97.5\% CI, 0.009 to ∞; P \&lt; .001 for noninferiority). Over 6 months, 72 of 84 (85.7\%) receiving buprenorphine implants and 64 of 89 (71.9\%) receiving sublingual buprenorphine maintained opioid abstinence (hazard ratio, 13.8; 95\% CI, 0.018-0.258; P = .03). Non–implant-related and implant-related adverse events occurred in 48.3\% and 23\% of the buprenorphine implant group and in 52.8\% and 13.5\% of participants in the sublingual buprenorphine group, respectively.Among adults with opioid dependence maintaining abstinence with a stable dose of sublingual buprenorphine, the use of buprenorphine implants compared with continued sublingual buprenorphine did not result in an inferior likelihood of remaining a responder. However, the study population had an exceptionally high response rate in the control group, and further studies are needed in broader populations to assess the efficacy in other settings.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02180659},

	abstract = {Background
Expansion of access to effective treatments for heroin dependence is a worldwide health priority that will also reduce HIV transmission. We compared the efficacy of naltrexone, buprenorphine, and no additional treatment, in patients receiving detoxification and subsequent drug counselling, for maintenance of heroin abstinence, prevention of relapse, and reduction of HIV risk behaviours.
Methods
126 detoxified heroin-dependent patients, from an outpatient research clinic and detoxification programme in Malaysia, were randomly assigned by a computer-generated randomisation sequence to 24 weeks of manual-guided drug counselling and maintenance with naltrexone (n=43), buprenorphine (n=44), or placebo (n=39). Medications were administered on a double-blind and double-dummy basis. Primary outcomes, assessed by urine testing three times per week, were days to first heroin use, days to heroin relapse (three consecutive opioid-positive urine tests), maximum consecutive days of heroin abstinence, and reductions in HIV risk behaviours over 6 months. The study was terminated after 22 months of enrolment because buprenorphine was shown to have greater efficacy in an interim safety analysis. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00383045.
Findings
We observed consistent, linear contrasts in days to first heroin use (p=0·0009), days to heroin relapse (p=0·009), and maximum consecutive days abstinent (p=0·0007), with all results best for buprenorphine and worst for placebo. Buprenorphine was associated with greater time to first heroin use than were naltrexone (hazard ratio 1·87 [95\% CI 1·21–2·88]) or placebo (2·02 [1·29–3·16]). With buprenorphine, we also recorded significantly greater time to heroin relapse (2·17 [1·38–3·42]), and maximum consecutive days abstinent than with placebo (mean days 59 [95\% CI 43–76] vs 24 [13–35]; p=0·003); however, for these outcomes, differences between buprenorphine and naltrexone were not significant. Differences between naltrexone and placebo were not significant for any outcomes. HIV risk behaviours were significantly reduced from baseline across all three treatments (p=0·003), but the reductions did not differ significantly between the three groups.
Interpretation
Our findings lend support to the widespread dissemination of maintenance treatment with buprenorphine as an effective public-health approach to reduce problems associated with heroin dependence.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Physicians may prescribe buprenorphine for opioid agonist maintenance treatment outside of narcotic treatment programs, but treatment guidelines for patients with co-occurring cocaine and opioid dependence are not available. This study compares effects of buprenorphine and methadone and evaluates the efficacy of combining contingency management with maintenance treatment for patients with co-occurring cocaine and opioid dependence. METHOD: Subjects with cocaine and opioid dependence (N=162) were provided manual-guided counseling and randomly assigned in a double-blind design to receive daily sublingual buprenorphine (12–16 mg) or methadone (65–85 mg p.o.) and to contingency management or performance feedback. Contingency management subjects received monetary vouchers for opioid- and cocaine-negative urine tests, which were conducted three times a week; voucher value escalated during the first 12 weeks for consecutive drug-free tests and was reduced to a nominal value in weeks 13–24. Performance feedback subjects received slips of paper indicating the urine test results. The primary outcome measures were the maximum number of consecutive weeks abstinent from illicit opioids and cocaine and the proportion of drug-free tests. Analytic models included two-by-two analysis of variance and mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Methadone-treated subjects remained in treatment significantly longer and achieved significantly longer periods of sustained abstinence and a greater proportion drug-free tests, compared with subjects who received buprenorphine. Subjects receiving contingency management achieved significantly longer periods of abstinence and a greater proportion drug-free tests during the period of escalating voucher value, compared with those who received performance feedback, but there were no significant differences between groups in these variables during the entire 24-week study. CONCLUSIONS: Methadone may be superior to buprenorphine for maintenance treatment of patients with co-occurring cocaine and opioid dependence. Combining methadone or buprenorphine with contingency management may improve treatment outcome.},

Overall, in the past 30 days at follow-up, interim participants reported significantly fewer days of heroin use (P\&lt;.001), had a significant reduction in heroin-positive drug test results (P\&lt;.001), reported spending less money on drugs (P\&lt;.001), and received less illegal income (P\&lt;.02) than the waiting list participants.Interim methadone maintenance results in a substantial increase in the likelihood of entry into comprehensive treatment, and is an effective means of reducing heroin use and criminal behavior among opioid-dependent individuals awaiting entry into a comprehensive methadone treatment program.{\textless}!--

MMT vs an alternative treatment, psychosocially enriched 180-day methadone-assisted
detoxification.DesignRandomized controlled trial conducted from May 1995 to April 1999.SettingResearch clinic in an established drug treatment service.PatientsOf 858 volunteers screened, 179 adults with diagnosed opioid dependence
were randomized into the study; 154 completed 12 weeks of follow-up.InterventionsPatients were randomized to MMT (n = 91), which required 2 hours of
psychosocial therapy per week during the first 6 months; or detoxification
(n = 88), which required 3 hours of psychosocial therapy per week, 14 education
sessions, and 1 hour of cocaine group therapy, if appropriate, for 6 months,
and 6 months of (nonmethadone) aftercare services.Main Outcome MeasuresTreatment retention, heroin and cocaine abstinence (by self-report and
monthly urinalysis), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors (Risk
of AIDS Behavior scale score), and function in 5 problem areas: employment,
family, psychiatric, legal, and alcohol use (Addiction Severity Index), compared
by intervention group.ResultsMethadone maintenance therapy resulted in greater treatment retention
(median, 438.5 vs 174.0 days) and lower heroin use rates than did detoxification.
Cocaine use was more closely related to study dropout in detoxification than
in MMT. Methadone maintenance therapy resulted in a lower rate of drug-related
(mean [SD] at 12 months, 2.17 [3.88] vs 3.73 [6.86]) but not sex-related HIV
risk behaviors and in a lower severity score for legal status (mean [SD] at
12 months, 0.05 [0.13] vs 0.13 [0.19]). There were no differences between
groups in employment or family functioning or alcohol use. In both groups,
monthly heroin use rates were 50\% or greater, but days of use per month dropped
markedly from baseline.ConclusionsOur results confirm the usefulness of MMT in reducing heroin use and
HIV risk behaviors. Illicit opioid use continued in both groups, but frequency
was reduced. Results do not provide support for diverting resources from MMT
into long-term detoxification.},

Naltrexone (or placebo) treatment was given as part of a general treatment plan that continued for 12 weeks. Thirty-two addicts who successfully completed a detoxification program and met research criteria, were included in the study. Fifty milligrams of Naltrexone were taken orally three times a week (25 mg twice a week for the first 2 weeks). The follow-up procedure included an interview, urine tests, and screening for possible adverse effects. In addition, social and psychological parameters were evaluated. Fewer heroin-positive urine tests were found the Naltrexone group than in the placebo group. Throughout the entire study, the number of drug-free patients in the Naltrexone group was higher than in the placebo group. The Naltrexone group showed a significant improvement in most psychological parameters as compared with the placebo group. No differences were found in compliance or ratio of adverse effects between the Naltrexone and placebo groups. The concept “heroin abuse load” based on daily heroin consumption and duration of addiction enabled us to predict which addicts would complete the treatment program.

The major aims were to compare the efficacy of Bup and Meth in a flexible dosing regimen and to identify possible predictors of outcome. There were no major inhomogeneities between treatment groups. All patients also received standardized psychosocial interventions. Mean daily dosages after the induction phase were 44–50 mg for Meth and 9–12 mg for Bup. Results from this study indicate a favourable outcome, with an overall retention rate of 52.1\% and no significant differences between treatment groups (55.3\% vs. 48.4\%). Substance use decreased significantly over time in both groups and was non-significantly lower in the Bup group. Predictors of outcome were length of continuous opioid use and age at onset of opioid use, although these were only significant in the Bup group. Mean dosage and other parameters were not significant predictors of outcome. Overall, the results of this study give further evidence that substitution treatment is a safe and effective treatment for drug dependence. Meth and Bup are equally effective. Duration of continuous opioid use and age at onset were found to have predictive value for negative outcome. The intensity of withdrawal symptoms showed the strongest correlation with drop-out. Future studies are warranted to further address patient profiles and outcome under different substitution regimens.},

In addition to pharmacotherapy, treatment during the clinical trial included individual counseling, weekly group therapy, and on-site medical services. Patients in both medication groups showed significant and substantial improvements over time in areas of psychosocial functioning, as assessed by the Addiction Severity Index, rates of urinalysis tests positive for opioids, and self-reports of opioid withdrawal symptoms, illicit opioid use, and cocaine use. Buprenorphine and methadone produced very similar outcomes on the wide array of outcome measures assessed, and improvements for both groups were large and occurred rapidly after treatment entry. A trend toward continued improvement in opioid-positive urines over time was noted for the buprenorphine but not the methadone group. These results provide further evidence of the efficacy of buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid dependence and provide a characterization of the time course of effects for buprenorphine and methadone. In addition, these results demonstrate the benefits of drug abuse treatment, both for drug and alcohol use and in other areas of psychosocial functioning. (J Clin Psychopharmacol 1996;16:58-67).},

	abstract = {Background People recovering from heroin addiction need better treatments than are currently offered. The chronic relapsing nature of drug dependence means that helping a patient to achieve abstinence is often difficult. Naltrexone blocks the effects of ingested heroin; however, evidence is conflicting regarding the best delivery method. Objectives The primary purpose of the trial was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone versus standard oral naltrexone versus relapse prevention therapy without medication for opioid use disorder (OUD). Design This was a 3-year, definitive, three-centre, three-arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised controlled trial. Setting Two specialist NHS outpatient addiction clinics: one in London and one in Birmingham. Participants Planned study sample – 300 adult patients with OUD who had completed detoxification. Interventions One iGen/Atral-Cipan Extended Release Naltrexone device (iGen/Atral-Cipan, Castanheira do Ribatejo, Portugal) (765 mg naltrexone or placebo) at day 0 of study week 1. Three weekly directly observed active or placebo oral naltrexone tablets (2 × 50 mg, Monday and Wednesday; 3 × 50 mg, Friday) at day 0 of study week 1 (for 4 weeks) and then an 8-week regimen of patient-administered dosing at the same dosing level. Main outcome measure The primary outcome measure was the proportion of heroin-negative urine drug screen (UDS) results at the end of the 12-week post-randomisation time point. Results Six patients were recruited and randomised to receive study interventions. Two patients had no positive UDS samples for heroin during the 12-week treatment period, one patient had only one positive UDS sample and the remaining patients had two, six and eight positive UDS results for heroin. All patients had at least one missed clinic visit (range 1–14). Conclusions Considerable problems were encountered with (1) the stipulated requirement of a validated ‘detoxified’ status prior to the initiation of the study naltrexone, (2) the requirement for a consent cooling-off period and (3) delays awaiting the surgical implant procedure. Major upheaval to the organisation and delivery of NHS community treatment services across England led to extremely poor levels of actual entry of patients into the trial. Research-vital clinical and procedural requirements were, therefore, more challenging to implement. The potential therapeutic value of the opioid antagonist naltrexone still needs clear investigation, including comparison of the established oral form with the new ultra-long-acting depot implant formulations (for which no licensed products exist in Europe). Despite the small number of study participants, some tentative conclusions can be reached, relevant to potential future work. The blinding of the active/placebo medications appeared to be good. Self-report was not sufficient to detect instances of heroin use. Self-report plus UDS information provided a fuller picture. Instances of lapsed heroin use were not necessarily followed by full relapse, and future work should consider the lapse–relapse relationship. The prison release setting also warrants special consideration. In future, investigators should consider seeking ethics approval for studies in which clinical procedures to accelerate the treatment process are permitted, even if outside orthodox clinical practice, if they address a clinical need at the time of challenge and clinical risk. In addition, it may be appropriate to seek exemption from the ordinary requirement of a cooling-off period after securing consent because it is often essential to initiate treatment promptly.

	abstract = {Background
Some heroin addicts persistently fail to benefit from conventional treatments. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of supervised injectable treatment with medicinal heroin (diamorphine or diacetylmorphine) or supervised injectable methadone versus optimised oral methadone for chronic heroin addiction.
Methods
In this multisite, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled chronic heroin addicts who were receiving conventional oral treatment (≥6 months), but continued to inject street heroin regularly (≥50\% of days in preceding 3 months). Randomisation by minimisation was used to assign patients to receive supervised injectable methadone, supervised injectable heroin, or optimised oral methadone. Treatment was provided for 26 weeks in three supervised injecting clinics in England. Primary outcome was 50\% or more of negative specimens for street heroin on weekly urinalysis during weeks 14–26. Primary analysis was by intention to treat; data were adjusted for centre, regular crack use at baseline, and treatment with optimised oral methadone at baseline. Percentages were calculated with Rubin's rules and were then used to estimate numbers of patients in the multiple imputed samples. This study is registered, ISRCTN01338071.
Findings
Of 301 patients screened, 127 were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive injectable methadone (n=42 patients), injectable heroin (n=43), or oral methadone (n=42); all patients were included in the primary analysis. At 26 weeks, 80\% (n=101) patients remained in assigned treatment: 81\% (n=34) on injectable methadone, 88\% (n=38) on injectable heroin, and 69\% (n=29) on oral methadone. Patients on injectable heroin were significantly more likely to have achieved the primary outcome (72\% [n=31]) than were those on oral methadone (27\% [n=11], OR 7·42, 95\% CI 2·69–20·46, p{\textless}0·0001; adjusted: 66\% [n=28] vs 19\% [n=8], 8·17, 2·88–23·16, p{\textless}0·0001), with number needed to treat of 2·17 (95\% CI 1·60–3·97). For injectable methadone (39\% [n=16]; adjusted: 30\% [n=14]) versus oral methadone, the difference was not significant (OR 1·74, 95\% CI 0·66–4·60, p=0·264; adjusted: 1·79, 0·67–4·82, p=0·249). For injectable heroin versus injectable methadone, a significant difference was recorded (4·26, 1·63–11·14, p=0·003; adjusted: 4·57, 1·71–12·19, p=0·002), but the study was not powered for this comparison. Differences were evident within the first 6 weeks of treatment.
Interpretation
Treatment with supervised injectable heroin leads to significantly lower use of street heroin than does supervised injectable methadone or optimised oral methadone. UK Government proposals should be rolled out to support the positive response that can be achieved with heroin maintenance treatment for previously unresponsive chronic heroin addicts.

	abstract = {To date, extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride has not previously been compared directly with opioid medication treatment (OMT), currently the most commonly prescribed treatment for opioid dependence.To determine whether treatment with extended-release naltrexone will be as effective as daily buprenorphine hydrochloride with naloxone hydrochloride in maintaining abstinence from heroin and other illicit substances in newly detoxified individuals.A 12-week, multicenter, outpatient, open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at 5 urban addiction clinics in Norway between November 1, 2012, and December 23, 2015; the last follow-up was performed on October 23, 2015. A total of 232 adult opioid-dependent (per DSM-IV criteria) individuals were recruited from outpatient addiction clinics and detoxification units and assessed for eligibility. Intention-to-treat analyses of efficacy end points were performed with all randomized participants.Randomization to either daily oral flexible dose buprenorphine-naloxone, 4 to 24 mg/d, or extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride, 380 mg, administered intramuscularly every fourth week for 12 weeks.Primary end points (protocol) were the randomized clinical trial completion rate, the proportion of opioid-negative urine drug tests, and number of days of use of heroin and other illicit opioids. Secondary end points included number of days of use of other illicit substances. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting.Of 159 participants, mean (SD) age was 36 (8.6) years and 44 (27.7\%) were women. Eighty individuals were randomized to extended-release naltrexone and 79 to buprenorphine-naloxone; 105 (66.0\%) completed the trial. Retention in the extended-release naltrexone group was noninferior to the buprenorphine-naloxone group (difference, −0.1; with 95\% CI, −0.2 to 0.1; P = .04), with mean (SD) time of 69.3 (25.9) and 63.7 (29.9) days, correspondingly (P = .33, log-rank test). Treatment with extended-release naltrexone showed noninferiority to buprenorphine-naloxone on group proportion of total number of opioid-negative urine drug tests (mean [SD], 0.9 [0.3] and 0.8 [0.4], respectively, difference, 0.1 with 95\% CI, −0.04 to 0.2; P \&lt; .001) and use of heroin (mean difference, −3.2 with 95\% CI, −4.9 to −1.5; P \&lt; .001) and other illicit opioids (mean difference, −2.7 with 95\% CI, −4.6 to −0.9; P \&lt; .001). Superiority analysis showed significantly lower use of heroin and other illicit opioids in the extended-release naltrexone group. No significant differences were found between the treatment groups regarding most other illicit substance use.Extended-release naltrexone was as effective as buprenorphine-naloxone in maintaining short-term abstinence from heroin and other illicit substances and should be considered as a treatment option for opioid-dependent individuals.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01717963},

All were offered weekly individual and group counseling.Opioid-positive urine test result at weeks 4, 8, and 12.The number of patients younger than 18 years was too small to analyze separately, but overall, patients in the detox group had higher proportions of opioid-positive urine test results at weeks 4 and 8 but not at week 12 (χ22 = 4.93, P = .09). At week 4, 28 detox patients had positive results (61\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 47\%-75\%) vs 15 12-week buprenorphine-naloxone patients (26\%; 95\% CI = 14\%-38\%).

During weeks 1 through 12, patients in the 12-week buprenorphine-naloxone group reported less opioid use (χ21 = 18.45, P \&lt; .001), less injecting (χ21 = 6.00, P = .01), and less nonstudy addiction treatment (χ21 = 25.82, P \&lt; .001). High levels of opioid use occurred in both groups at follow-up. Four of 83 patients who tested negative for hepatitis C at baseline were positive for hepatitis C at week 12.Continuing treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone improved outcome compared with short-term detoxification.
