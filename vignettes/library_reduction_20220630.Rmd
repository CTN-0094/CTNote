# Introduction
This document contains the algorithms necessary to code all the outcomes which measure "substance use reduction". We only include outcomes which result in a single value per subject. These outcomes are:
```{r, import-table-one, include=FALSE}
pathToTable1_char <- system.file(
  "suppl_docs", "definitions_20220405.xlsx", package = "CTNote", mustWork = TRUE
)
tab1_df <- readxl::read_xlsx(pathToTable1_char) 
```

```{r, tidy-table-one, include=FALSE}
tabTidy1_df <- 
  tab1_df %>% 
  select(-`Frequency of UOS`, -`Coded column name`, -DOI) %>% 
  rename(
    Group = `Outcome Group`,
    Endpoint = `Primary Endpoint`,
    Class = `Numeric Class`,
    Definition = `Definition/Assessment of Outcome`,
    `Missing is` = `Missing UOS coded as`
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    Group = case_when(
      str_detect(Group, "Abstinence") ~ "Abstinence",
      str_detect(Group, "Relapse") ~ "Relapse",
      str_detect(Group, "Reduction") ~ "Reduction",
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(Group == "Reduction") %>% 
  arrange(Reference)

defns_char <- tabTidy1_df$Definition
names(defns_char) <- tabTidy1_df$Reference
```


```{r, show-table-one-reduction, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
tabTidy1_df  %>% 
  kable("html") %>%
  column_spec(1:4, width = "3cm") %>%
  column_spec(5, width = "5cm") %>%
  kable_styling("striped", font_size = 11) %>%
  kable_minimal() %>% 
  # All styling and spec calls have to come BEFORE this line.
  scroll_box(width = "1000px", height = "500px") 
```

We will use the table of participant opioid use patterns from the `ctn0094DataExtra` package to calculate these endpoints (we have a copy of the endpoints in the dataset `outcomesCTN0094`). Importantly, if you wish to apply these algorithms to calculate endpoints for your data, the participants' substance use patterns must be stored in the "substance use pattern word" format shown here. We also show a subset of the data to visualize a variety of different real substance use patterns.

We first define the following five-value legend:

- **+**: positive for the substance(s) in a specified window of time (a day, week, month, etc.) by urine screen (or participant self report, if such data are of interest)
- **â€“**: negative for the substance(s)
- **o**: subject failed to provide a urine sample
- <b>*</b>: inconclusive results or mixed results (e.g. subject provided more than one urine sample in the time interval and they did not agree)
- <b>_</b>: no specimens required (weekends, holidays, pre-randomization period, alternating visit days/weeks)

```{r}
###  Full Data  ###
udsOutcomes_df <- 
	CTNote::outcomesCTN0094 %>% 
  select(who, usePatternUDS)

# Make a copy
outcomesRed_df <- udsOutcomes_df


###  Examples  ###
examplePeople_int <- c(1, 163, 210, 242, 4, 17, 13, 1103, 233, 2089)
outcomesRed_df %>% 
  filter(who %in% examplePeople_int)
```

For example, participant 1 has a use pattern `ooooooooooooooo` (all missing UDS), which means that they dropped out of the study. In contrast, participant 233 has a use pattern `*+++++++++++o++++++++++o` (nearly all positive UDS): they did not drop out of the study, but the treatment was completely ineffective for them. Participant 2089 started the study in a rough patch, but greatly improved in treatment over time (`++++---+--------------o-`).

**Definition**: `r defns_char["Eissenberg et al., 1997"]`

From [their paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9200635/), we read "Where urinalysis data were missing for an entire week (5 of 1836 data points; 0.3%) the average of that patient's results from the 2 weeks surrounding the missing week was substituted for the missing value." Also, because some of our trials only retained subjects for 15-16 weeks, we changed the cutoff to 15 weeks in order to apply this definition to our data.

```{r, include=FALSE}

There are two definitions from [this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9684386/) which we include in the reduction section our library: `r defns_char[[whichLing_idx[1]]]` and `r defns_char[[whichLing_idx[2]]]`. Both of these outcome definitions **exclude** missing UDS. We also include an abstinence endpoint from this paper in our "abstinence and relapse endpoints" section.

## @ling_methadyl_1976
**Definition**: `r defns_char["Ling, Charuvastra, Kaim, & Klett, 1976"]`

### Original
The definition in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.1976.01770060043007) is quite complex, but very well thought out. It is one of our favorite MOUD treatment endpoints because of its flexibility.
```{r}
outcomesRed_df <- 
	outcomesRed_df %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  # Rule 1: mark induction failures
  # The Ling et al. protocol lasted 40 weeks while requiring 7 weeks of data for
  #   the subjects to be counted as "estimable participants"; our 3 studies each
	#   lasted at least 15 weeks. Therefore, we should require at least
  #   (7/40) * 15) ~= 3 weeks of data to consider a participant "estimable"
	mutate(
		inductFail = measure_retention(usePatternUDS) <= 3
	) %>% 
	mutate(
		usePatternTrunc = str_sub(usePatternUDS, end = 15)
	) %>% 
	# Rules 2-4: weighting and scaling visits. The flexibility here is amazing.
	#   If we think that dropout is worse than positive, then we can reflect that
	#   in the weights. Ling et al. counted a missing visit as 0.22 of a positive;
  #   and they use a step function to increase the penalty of a positive UDS 
  #   over time.
	mutate(
		ling1976o22_use = weight_positive_visits(
			use_pattern = usePatternTrunc,
			weights_num = c(`+` = 1.0, `*` = 0.5, `o` = 0.22, `-` = 0),
			posPenalty_num = rep(1:5, each = 3) # step function for 15 weeks
		)
	) %>% 
	mutate(
		ling1976o22_use = case_when(
			inductFail  ~ 120,
			!inductFail ~ ling1976o22_use
		),
		ling1976o22_abs = 120 - ling1976o22_use
	) %>%
	select(who, ling1976o22_abs) %>% 
	left_join(outcomesRed_df, ., by = "who")

outcomesRed_df %>% 
  filter(who %in% examplePeople_int) %>% 
  select(who, usePatternUDS, ling1976o22_abs)
```

### A Variant
We also include a variant of this definition which includes a greater penalty for missing values and a smooth function to increase weights of positive UDS.
```{r}
outcomesRed_df <- 
	outcomesRed_df %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
	mutate(
		inductFail = measure_retention(usePatternUDS) <= 3
	) %>% 
	mutate(
		usePatternTrunc = str_sub(usePatternUDS, end = 15)
	) %>% 
	mutate(
		ling1976o100_use = weight_positive_visits(
			use_pattern = usePatternTrunc,
			# Higher weight for missing values
			weights_num = c(`+` = 0.8, `*` = 0.4, `o` = 1.0, `-` = 0),
			# Smooth penalty function for increasing positive UDS
			posPenalty_num = seq(
				from = 1, to = 5, length.out = str_length(usePatternTrunc)
			)
		)
	) %>% 
	mutate(
	  ling1976o100_use = case_when(
			inductFail  ~ 120,
			!inductFail ~ ling1976o100_use
		),
		ling1976o100_abs = 120 - ling1976o100_use
	) %>%
	select(who, ling1976o100_abs) %>% 
	left_join(outcomesRed_df, ., by = "who")

outcomesRed_df %>% 
  filter(who %in% examplePeople_int) %>% 
  select(who, usePatternUDS, ling1976o100_abs)
```


## @lofwall_weekly_2018
**Definition**: `r defns_char["Lofwall et al., 2018"]`; but urine screens are collected each week for the first 12 weeks, then every other week for weeks 13-24. 
We project this onto a 15-16 week protocol by requiring UDS each week for the first 7 weeks, then every other week for the next 8. Then, we impute the skipped weeks to be whatever the value of the UDS was from the last visit.
```{r}
###  Define a Visit Pattern (Lattice)  ###
lofwallLattice_char <- collapse_lattice(
	lattice_patterns = c("o", "_o"),
	# For the lattice as defined over 24 weeks, you need 12 weeks of weekly visits
	#   and 6 sets of alternating "no visit" and "visit" week pairs, or c(12, 6).
	#   For us, we want 7 weeks straight of weekly visits followed by 4 pairs of
	#   alternating visits (8 weeks) for a total of 15 weeks.

## @strain_moderate-_1999
**Definition**: `r defns_char["Strain, Bigelow, Liebson, & Stitzer, 1999"]`

[This paper](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.281.11.1000) gave no commentary on *how* the missing values would be processed, only that the statistical software SAS was capable of handling missing values. SAS, by default, [excludes missing values](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.5/proc/n026epq8bpz1f9n10oeb7zen7s1e.htm) from analyses. Therefore, this definition will also be identical to that of Strain, Stitzer, Liebson, & Bigelow (1994).
```{r}

[This paper](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2008.574) contains rather exotic methods for missing value imputation, but the authors remark that setting "missing is positive" did not change their final results. We may include their imputation method in future versions of this code library.
