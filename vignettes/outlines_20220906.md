# Overview
Split the current manuscript into 3 papers:

1. CTNote vignette (**PLOS One**)
    + Short introduction: 1 paragraph of addiction / medication for SUD trial outcomes
    + Methods: The Quinary word
    + Results:
        i. 3 example outcomes
        ii. Algorithms for the 3 example outcomes
        iii. Mention outcomes library
    + Brief discussion of strengths and limitations
2. Outcomes Clustering (**Addiction**?? **Drug and Alcohol Dependence**??)
    + Laura’s introduction and full table of all outcomes for MOUD
    + Methods: cite PLOS One paper for the "magic"; describe clustering approach
    + Clustering results
    + Discussion of clinical implications (*"how to choose an appropriate outcome"* section)
3. Trial Outcomes and Algorithmic Bias [with C. Castro] (**a journal that cares about health disparities in treatment and/or ML ethics**)
    + Introduction of MSUD trials and trial outcomes
    + Introduction of "bias" in algorithms (C. Castro)
    + Methods: inverted multinomial model, information criteria for model evaluation
    + Results and discussion of immediate implications (including Dan Feaster’s comment that "an outcome having a significant result may not imply that there’s a problem with the outcome itself, but perhaps it is highlighting a problem with the trial design")
    + Broad discussion of limitations to these results and potential pitfalls in their interpretation, C. Castro comments here on philosophy and ethics of ML
